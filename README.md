CareCalendar is a custom-built scheduling application created with TypeScript and Redux, using Vite for project building. It offers a highly customizable and interactive calendar interface that allows users to manage appointments effectively. The calendar was built from scratch to incorporate specific business logic and provide an intuitive user experience.

## Features

- **Custom-Built Calendar**: Unlike tradi
tional calendar libraries, CareCalendar is built from the ground up, giving it the flexibility to incorporate specific functionalities and business logic tailored to the needs of the application.

- **State Management with Redux**: The application uses Redux for state management, ensuring a predictable and efficient state container for managing appointment data and calendar interactions.

- **Dynamic Date Highlighting**:
  - The **current date** is highlighted with a **yellow cell**, making it easy for users to quickly identify today's date.
  - When an **appointment is set** on any date, the corresponding cell color changes to **blue**, providing a clear visual indicator that an appointment exists on that date.

- **Reset Button**: A simple **Reset button** allows users to navigate back to the home page, providing a convenient way to reset their view or actions.

- **Built with Vite**: The project leverages **Vite** for its development environment, offering fast builds and hot module replacement for an enhanced development experience.

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and scalability for future enhancements.
- **Redux**: Centralized state management for predictable state transitions.
- **Vite**: Modern build tool that delivers fast build times and improved development workflows.
